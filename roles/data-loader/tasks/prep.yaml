# See https://docs.ansible.com/ansible-tower/latest/html/userguide/job_templates.html
# for an up-to-date set, but ones we rely on in order to protect the
# job for malfunctioning are: -
#
# - tower_user_id (the ID, a number)
# - tower_user_name (The username for logging, namespace and URL)

#
# If we're using OpenShift credentials these environment variables
# will not be set and we will therefore rely on them being set
# from the 'login.yaml' play.
