# Variables,
# but not ones the user is typically expected to adjust.

# Fragalysis Stack configuration ----------------------------------------------

# The state of the stack,
# one of 'present' or 'absent'
stack_state: present

# Used typically by the staging deployment (which uses a copy of
# production database and media). This variable prevents the
# playbook from running if the Database volume is found in the namespace.
# This is used to prevent a user running consecutive replications of
# production to staging without running the 'shutdown' play between them.
#
# The user is required to 'shutdown' between replications to
# a) create a clean copy of the production database, and
# b) force the stack to run through its migrations.
#
# The 'production replica' workflow will set this value to 'no'
stack_allow_pre_existing_database_volume: yes
# Is an existing media volume permitted?
# Added for latest staging deployment, which fails if the volume is present.
stack_allow_pre_existing_media_volume: yes

# Whether to remove the media volume when 'shutting down' the stack
# (used by the shutdown play). By default the media volume
# (time-consuming to recreate) is left alone during shutdown.
stack_shutdown_remove_media_volume: no
# Same with database volume (default is to 'remove')
stack_shutdown_remove_database_volume: yes

# The Pod Security Policy (expected to exist in the cluster)
# that is used by the stack Role object.
stack_sa_psp: im-core-unrestricted
# The stack certificate issuer
# For use with the Kubernetes cert-manager
# deployed by the Informatics Matters infrastructure playbook.
# If blank ('') there will be no certificate.
