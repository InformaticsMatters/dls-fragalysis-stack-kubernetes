Ansible Playbooks (and Roles) for the deployment of the XChem [Fragalysis Stack]
application to Kubernetes. This repository builds on the work accomplished
by our [OpenShift deployment] and yields plays that can be run from an [AWX]
server.

## Preparation
You'll need a Python environment where you need to install the project
requirements (for Python and Ansible): -

    $ python -m venv ~/.venv/dls-fragalysis-stack-kubernetes
    $ source ~/.venv/dls-fragalysis-stack-kubernetes/bin/activate
    
    $ pip install --upgrade pip
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt
    $ ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.yaml --force
    $ ansible-galaxy collection install -r collection-requirements.yaml --force

## Configuring the AWX server
To setup the AWX server for a specific cluster refer to the `README`
in the `awx-configuration` directory.

## Editing the sensitive.vault
Certain, sensitive, variables are located in the encrypted file
`roles/fragalysis-stack/vars/sensitive.vault`. This file should not be
committed un-encrypted and can be edited from the project root without 
decrypting it, armed with the repository vault password, using: -

    $ ansible-vault edit roles/fragalysis-stack/vars/sensitive.vault

## Project documentation
The documentation is written in [Sphinx]. To build the documentation
which results in the main index page `docs/build/html/index.html`,
run the following from the project root: -

    $ pip install -r build-requirements.txt
    $ sphinx-build -Eab html docs/source docs/build/html

The project documentation is also published to [Read The Docs],
where you can find pre-compiled copies online.
