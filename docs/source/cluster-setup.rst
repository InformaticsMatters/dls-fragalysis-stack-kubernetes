These instructions cover deployment of a basic production-grade
Frgalsysis Stack (without custom authentication).

This requires the installation of the underlying infrastructure components
(a PostgreSQL instance and `AWX`_, the open-source upstream distribution of
RedHat's Ansible `Tower`_).

Deployment of the Graph and Fragalysis Stack is achieved through the use
of Jobs that are configured on the AWX server, all of which is described here.
