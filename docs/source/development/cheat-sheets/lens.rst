    Some useful ``lens`` operations that might be useful during development.

Viewing namespace Pods
    Selecting **Workloads -> Pods** will normally show ou all the Pods
    in all namespaces.

    Use the `Namespace Filter` to select one (or more)
    namespaces you want to view. For example the **Staging Stack**...

Display Pod container logs
    With a Pod visible in the **Workloads** screen you can click it
    to see a description panel for the Pod slide-in from the right...

    .. image:: ../../images/lens-screenshot-workloads-staging-stack.png

    In the banner of the panel that's presented you'll see four icons
    representing the **Shell**, **Logs**, **Edit** and **Delete**
    actions...

    Click the logs icon to see the Pod's logs...

Shell into a Pod container
    With a Pod visible in the **Workloads** screen you can click it
    to see a description panel for the Pod slide-in from the right...

    .. image:: ../../images/lens-screenshot-workloads-staging-stack.png

    In the banner of the panel that's presented you'll see four icons
    representing the **Shell**, **Logs**, **Edit** and **Delete**
    actions...

    .. image:: ../../images/lens-screenshot-pod-description.png

    Click the shell icon to be taken to an interactive shell in your
    chosen Pod...

    To exit the shell hit the shell terminal window's close icon.

Restarting a Pod (scale down and up)
    In order to scale-up (or scale-down) a set of Pods you will need to edit
    their **Deployment**, or **StatefulSet**, whichever is appropriate.
    The Fragalysis Stack Pod, for example, is managed by a **StatefulSet**.
    With **Workloads -> StatefulSets** selected (and the appropriate Stack's
    namespace chosen in the namespace filter) click **Stack** to see
    the its description.

    .. image:: ../../images/lens-screenshot-statefulset-description.png

    Click the pencil (Edit) Icon in the description banner to be presented
    with the YAML representation of the stack's StatefulSet.

    .. image:: ../../images/lens-screenshot-statefulset-yaml.png

    Scroll down if required to locate the ``replicas:`` field. To scale-down
    the Pods set this to 0 and then click **Save & Close**. To scale the Pods
    up, set this field to 1 or more.
