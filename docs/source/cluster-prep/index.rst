Cluster Preparation

These instructions cover deployment of a basic production-grade
Fragalysis Stack (without custom authentication).

This requires the installation of the underlying infrastructure components: -

*   An ingress controller (nginx in our case)
*   Pod Security Policies
*   Certificate management
*   A PostgreSQL database
*   `AWX`_ (the open-source upstream distribution of
    RedHat's Ansible `Tower`_)
*   An optional `Keycloak`_ server.

One the infrastructure is satisfied, deployment of the Graph-based fragment
database and Fragalysis Stack is achieved through the use of Jobs that are
configured on the AWX server.

What follows is a simplified guide to setting up a basic [#f1]_ deployment of
the Fragalysis Stack through a number of stages: -

.. [#f1] An cluster with an AWX server and a Fragalysis Stack without
         custom credentials or backup and recovery strategies. A cluster
         with the ability to use the stack with publicly available graph
         fragment data.
