Deploying the Fragment Graph
############################

.. note:: Allow **2 hours** to install all of the applications.

With the AWX server configured we can now run the **Job Templates** that
are responsible for deploying the various applications.

Start by logging into the AWX application server as the demo user ``demo``.
From there you should be able to navigate to the **Templates** screen where
all the templates are presented to you.

.. note:: Allow 2 hours to complete this task.

Deploy the Fragmentation graph by *launching* the **Fragmentation Graph**
template.

.. image:: ../../images/demo-job-templates-fragmentation-graph.png

.. epigraph::

    The jobs have been configured to first present a confirmation dialogue box
    so that you can adjust some key job variables before they run. for example,
    the **Fragmentation Graph** job allows you to provide a path to the
    graph data you want to deploy (using the ``graph_bucket_path`` variable).

Acknowledge the dialogue (clicking **Next**) and then the **Launch** button.

As the graph initialisation can take some time the job does not
(at the time of writing) wait for the graph to initialise. We therefore use the
``kubectl`` command-line to check on the status of the graph before moving on.
Check that the graph namespace exists::

    $ kubectl get namespace/graph
    NAME    STATUS   AGE
    graph   Active   7s

And then *watch* the Graph Pod status until it's ``Running``. The
graph contains an initialisation container used to download the graph
data to the cluster::

    $ kubectl get pod/graph-0 -n graph -w
    NAME      READY   STATUS     RESTARTS   AGE
    graph-0   0/1     Init:0/1   0          14s
    graph-0   0/1     Init:0/1   0          95s
    graph-0   0/1     Init:0/1   0          100s
    graph-0   0/1     PodInitializing   0          108s
    graph-0   1/1     Running           0          114s

Once you see ``Running`` the Pod has started and you can ``ctrl-c`` from the
command.

The graph needs to *import* the downloaded files into a graph database, which
can take a significant length of time, depending on the data that's been
downloaded.

You can *follow* the Graph Pod's logs and wait for the import process to complete.
The graph import typically involved 4 stages that are easily followed from the
logs.

The output here has been truncated because there is a lot of it.

Importantly, to be confident the deployment has worked, you must see: -

*   A section starting ``(1/4) Node import``
*   A section starting ``(2/4) Relationship import``
*   A section starting ``(3/4) Relationship linking``
*   A section starting ``(4/4) Post processing``

And, finally, you're waiting to see the word ``Finished.`` issued by the
``cypher-runner.sh`` script::

    $ kubectl logs pod/graph-0 -n graph -f

Once you see that you can ``ctrl-c`` from the *follow* command and continue
with the remaining applications.
