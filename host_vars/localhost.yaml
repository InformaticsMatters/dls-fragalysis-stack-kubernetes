# Providing your own Kubernetes image pull secrets.
#
# If you have moved the public (docker.io and quay.io) images to
# your own private binary repository like JFrog Artifactory
# you probably need to provide a pull secret for all the images.
# One pull secret must valid for all images.
#
#   - Create the application namespaces in advance of the playbooks
#   - Create the pull secret in each namespace
#   - Provide the name of the secret in the following variable
#     (which will be used for all images)
#
# You must use all public images or you must use all private images.
# You cannot put some images into a private repo and rely on
# public images for the rest - it's "all or none".
